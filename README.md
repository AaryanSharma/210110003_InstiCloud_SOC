Learnt how to use git and javascript basics along with ethereum and blockchain introduction in the first two weeks and did an assigment for the javascript basics. In the third and fourth week we learnt React.js and Next.js framework. After fourth week we were introduced to gun.js , decentralized server , p2p network. How decentralized server works and how p2p network is encrypted by salting and by asymmetric and symmetric encrytion. Then we were divided into 3 segments (Frontend , Decenteralized Server, p2p network). I was in the frontend team with two of the mentees (Devang and Pradyuman). There were 3 pages to be made - login page , signup page and the files section page. I was doing the signup page. 

The assignment 1 was the checklist our mentors gave us after week 2 when we learnt javascript. It was to test if we had grasped the concepts of javascript or not. The signup folder contains the webpage I made for the project using CodeSandbox.io using javascript and react.js
